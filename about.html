                Luke Her is of second generation of Hmong that was born in the US. He has three brothers and one sister. He is the second youngest of all the siblings. 
                He graduated from High School in 2012. He got his CNC Certification in 2015 and got a job offer in Madison, Wisconsin due to being recommended by his instructor. 
                He became interested in being a CNC Machinist due to his experiences in his Technology Education classes during his Junior High and High School years. 
                He believes that his profession is of high value because there are not enough people interested in such a high demanding profession. 
                He lived in Madison for a year and a half by himself until his older sister moved in with him to do an internship. 
                After he had finished his two year CNC Machine experience in Madison, Wisconsin, he decided to move to Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
                The reason for his sudden move was because he did not have any relatives or family in Madison. He felt very lonely in Madison and decided to move to Minneapolis 
                because he had more relatives in the Twin Cities area. The Twin Cities also offered a larger variety of concerts for him to go to since it is a larger metropolitan area than Madison.

                His hobbies did not fully come to life until he was in Madison and had a budget to fully explore his hobbies. While he was in school to become a CNC Machine Operator, 
                he did not have the funds to purchase a good drum set. After a few months in Madison with a good income, he purchased many things such as an expensive drum kit that was 
                of high quality. He also started to explore boutique drum brands in the local area of Madison. Upon moving to Minneapolis, he continued to purchase other drum equipment 
                and an electric drum kit due to living in an apartment. To this day, he continues to visit the local drum shops and also purchases other drum accessories.
