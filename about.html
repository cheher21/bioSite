                <p>Luke Her is of first Hmong generation whom had come to the United States after the Vietnam 
                    War in 1975. Luke has three brothers and one sister. He is the second youngest with the 
                    youngest being his brother. He graduated from High School in 2012 from Stevens Point WI. He 
                    got his CNC Certification in 2015 and first moved to Madison WI for work due to having good 
                    network with his instructor. He decided to be a CNC Machinist due to having a liking to working 
                    in his Tech Ed classes during his Junior High and High School days. He firmly believes that his 
                    profession is of high value and that there are not enough people interested in such a high 
                    demanding profession. While in Madison, he lived there for a year and a half by himself until his 
                    older sister moved there to do an internship. After he had finished his two year experience in 
                    Madison, he decided to move back to Minneapolis. The reason for his move so suddenly was because 
                    of there were no relatives nor family in Madison. He felt very lonely in Madison and 
                    decided to move to Minneapolis because there were much more family in the Twin Cities area. 
                    The cites also offer more concerts for him to go to because it was a hot spot for the indie bands 
                    to tour through rather than Madison.

                    His hobbies did not fully come to life until he was in Madison and had an budget to fully explore 
                    his hobbies. While he was in school to become a CNC Machine Operator, he did not have the 
                    funds to purchase a good drum set. After a few months in Madison with a good income, he 
                    purchased many things such as an expensive drum kit that was of high quality. He also started to 
                    explore boutique drum brands in the local area of Madison. Upon moving to Minneapolis, he 
                    continued to purchase other drum equipment and an electric drum kit due to living in an 
                    apartment. To this day, he continues to visit the local drum shops and also buy other drum 
                    accessories.
