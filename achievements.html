                    The first time Luke went to college, he went to a technical college to get his welding technical diploma in 2014. 
                    Upon finishing school he went straight into the work force in a local manufacturing company that welded parts together. 
                    He started two weeks upon finishing school and worked on second shift. He continued to work there for another until the following summer of 2015. 
                    After one year of working as a welder, he had decided that welding was not something that he wanted to do because of a few negative factors. 
                    He then decided to change career and went back to school to do another profession that pays more and has less strain on his body. 
                    This is where he continued his education and got his Machine Tool Technical Diploma in spring of 2016. The program only 
                    took a school year for him to complete because he had already taken most of the prerequisites when he went for welding.

                <h2>Moving to a New City Twice</h2>

                    When Luke completed his welding diploma, he remained home with his parents and worked in at a company located five minutes away. Like 
                    most young folks who still lived with their parents, there were limitations. After he graduated with his Machine Tool diploma, he decided 
                    to move to Madison Wisconsin. Stevens Point is a fairly small city compared to Madison. Stevens Point has about twenty six thousand 
                    population and Madison has a population of two-hundred and fifty-four thousand. Smaller cities are limited in compare to larger cities. 
                    Madison was almost ten times the size of Stevens Point. He lived in Madison with a new beginning while finding a new community and new friends 
                    for two and a half years. He then decided to move to the Minneapolis area. An area that was twice the size of Madison which had a population 
                    of four-hundred and twenty thousand. He has remained in the Minneapolis area for the past two years and does not plan to move. In both 
                    Madison and Minneapolis, he had to find a new community and new friends as he did not know many people in either of the cities.

                    Luke did not enjoy his time as a welder. There were many things that he did not like that the job after a year. There were a few 
                    things that concerned him as he reached his one year mark. First was the light from when the weld would happen. He was concern that 
                    the light would eventually render him partially blind due to constantly looking at the flash when welding. This is called “welding flash” 
                    where a welder can suffer from if they are exposed to the ultraviolet light from the weld. Second, he always smelled of metal due to the 
                    work environment that he was in. There were always debris of metal on his clothes after a long day work. Third, the welding gun torch 
                    had taken a toll on his hand. Due to long exposures of holding the welding gun for hours at a time for an entire year, his hand had become 
                    cramped to the shape of holding a welding gun. Even when he slept, his hand would hold the muscle memory of that shape. He also couldn’t play 
                    the drums due to this condition. This is called carpal tunnel. After completing his Machine Tool Technical Diploma in 2016, he had become a 
                    CNC Machinist. The job took less strained from his body such as not having to look directly into a ultraviolet light, having carpal tunnel 
                    while holding the welding gun, and having less of a metal smell. The job required less and the pay was more.
