            <p> He likes to play drums on his free time. The type of music that he likes to play are the same as 
                the concerts he attends locally here in the Minneapolis area. He has an electric drum kit along 
                with an acoustic drum kit. Both drum kits are of high quality and are expensive. He only plays for 
                fun and does not have a band to play with. He also has many custom drum snare that he has 
                purchased for himself. A snare is what a music band would be playing such as during a parade or 
                at a football game.

            <h2>Attending Concerts</h2>

            <p>
                The type of concerts that he likes to go to are indie music or also known as independent music. 
                He also likes a mixture of other genre such as metal and rock. But the majority of the concerts 
                that he goes to are instrumental band concerts. What this means is that there are no singing 
                involve. The band only plays music with a electric guitarist, bass guitarist, and drummer. There 
                are usually around four to six musicians in the band. The bands that he usually goes to the 
                concert to are Polyphia, Chon, Intervals and Animals As Leaders. At the concerts like these, there 
                is usually a mosh pit around the center of the concert area. Here in the mosh pit, the audience
                would aggressively dance, jump, and bump each other. They also push each other around while
                still dancing to the music. Mosh pit is something that does not happen all the time at these 
                concerts as it is dependent on the concert location. If the venue does not have the allocated
                space, the bouncers or security for the venue will not allow the mosh pit to happen.
